      <p>When you record a decision for this paper and email the author, the reviewersâ€™ comments will be made available to that author through their account area on this site. By default, they will be shown the comments as submitted by the reviewer. Use this form to edit those comments first if necessary; the author will be shown what you enter into this box instead of the original comments.</p>
