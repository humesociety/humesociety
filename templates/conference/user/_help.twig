<p>The dropdown menus for inviting someone to review or comment on a paper, or chair a session, are populated with users in our database. Rather than include every user in the database in these menus, however, which would make the menus inconveniently large, you can indicate which users you would like included by selecting them from the list below. Note that the numbers next to each user show the proportion of invitations accepted (and completed) to invitations sent.</p>
