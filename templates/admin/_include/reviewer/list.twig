<p>In order to invite someone to review a paper, you must first create a record for them in the database. These records will remain in place, helping subsequent conference organisers. Records can be created from current users, or alternatively by inputting a name and an email address by hand.</p>
<p>In the list below, the <em>willing</em> field shows whether the reviewer has explicitly indicated a willingness to receive invitations to review (a “no” in this field does not necessarily mean they are unwilling). The <em>invited</em> and <em>accepted</em> fields show, respectively, how many review invitations they have received and how many they have accepted.</p>
